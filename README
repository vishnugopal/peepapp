Peepapp is a new kind of distributed computing platform. It makes map-reduce problems easy, with map and reduce elements being performed by a connected "master" node, and calculations performed by anybody with a browser.

Use:

* Ruby EE
* Starling, memcached & memcache-client
* No DB (wowee!)
* Nginx

Nginx -> passenger_nginx_module -> rack -> sinatra

A very simple sinatra app will do. Sinatra seems apt.

Demos:

* See /pi/index.html
